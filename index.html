                                    <p>Chris and his family have had their
                                        roots within the Williamsport Area 
                                        and Central Pennsylvania region for 
                                        four decades. He graduated from Bucknell 
                                        University in Lewisburg, PA and then 
                                        received his Juris Doctorate from the 
                                        Widener University School of Law in
